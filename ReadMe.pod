=head1 Installation

The simplest way to install C<lw> is:

manpages.

Add the C<source …> line above to your shell's startup file to make it
persistent. The path to the C<init> script must be an absolute path.

=head1 System Dependencies

Ths command requires the following common system tools:

=over

=item * Bash 3.2 or higher

=item * Git 1.7.0 or higher

=item * C<curl>

=back

At this stage, it probably will only work on a POSIX system (ie not Windows).

=head1 Configuration

The LW API needs to know your user name and password for your Liquid Web
account. You'll need to use the C<lw config> command to set these.
