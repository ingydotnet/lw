`lw` is a commandline tool for interacting with the Liquid Web public API. ie
Creating VM servers with your liquid web account, getting server information,
etc. See:

* https://www.liquidweb.com/
* https://www.stormondemand.com/api/docs/v1/

= Installation

The simplest way to install `lw` is:

  git clone https://github.com/ingydotnet/lw
  source $PWD/lw/init

Now the `lw` command is ready to use, including command completion and
manpages.

Add the `source …` line above to your shell's startup file to make it
persistent. The path to the `init` script must be an absolute path.

= Commands

- `config`

  …

- `server-create`

  …

= System Dependencies

Ths command requires the following common system tools:

* Bash 3.2 or higher
* Git 1.7.0 or higher
* `curl`

At this stage, it probably will only work on a POSIX system (ie not Windows).

= Configuration

The LW API needs to know your user name and password for your Liquid Web
account. You'll need to use the `lw config` command to set these.
